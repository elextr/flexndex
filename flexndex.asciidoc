Introduction
------------

Most documentation tools let you generate an index of terms in the
document, but often it is useful to be able to generate indices for
special purposes.  For example if you are documenting software and
index to functions, an index to types etc may be useful.

Flexndex is a flexible tool to generate multiple indices as document
internal links, making it usable with most XML based document formats,
eg xhtml, docbook or Open Document Format.

Terminology
-----------

index:: a list of index entries organised by category
index entry:: a link to a target in the document where there is
content relevant to the categories of the entry
target:: the point in the document that you want an index entry to
point to with a list of terms for categorisation
terms:: hierarchical set of text items to categorize the entry within
the index

Operation
---------

Flexndex takes index target information encoded in XML comments,
generates the link anchor at that position and records the specified
index terms.  It also takes requests for index inclusion encoded in XML
comments and generates lists of links to the relevant targets at that
position.

The markup of anchors and link lists is configurable and selected by
name then document type, so documents in several formats can be
accomodated.

Flexndex does not specify how the formatted XML comments are included
in the document, but most document tools allow their inclusion, see
<<uwa, Using with Asciidoc>> for an example of configuring the
Asciidoc tool.

Comment Format
--------------

Index Target Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The format of the comments specifying index terms is:

----
<!-- ix indexname <attribute_list> -->
----

Note that the spaces shown above are part of the format, use only one
space.

The +indexname+ is the name of the index this target is part of.

The +attribute_list+ is a comma separated list of:

- index terms in order of primary, secondary, tertiary etc, followed by
- named attributes in name=value form.

Flexndex does not restrict how many levels an index has.

Named attributes other than the predefined ones will be available for
substitution into the output markup, either in the anchor or the entry
in the index.

The predefined named attributes are:

text:: the text to use in the index entry for links to this target.

Index Inclusion Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The format of the comments requesting inclusion of an index is:

----
<!-- ixhere indexname <attribute_list> -->
----

Note that the spaces shown above are part of the format, use only one
space.

The +indexname+ is the name of the index to put here.

The attribute list has the same format as the index term definition.
Any initial index terms request that the index placed here be
restricted to only entries that are prefixed by the specified terms.

Named attributes other than the predefined ones will be available for
substitution into the output markup of the index.

The predefined named attributes are:

levels:: limit the output to these levels.
+
n1-n2::: from level n1 to level n2 inclusive
n1-::: from level n1 up inclusive
-n1, n1::: up to level n1 inclusive
+
where n1 and n2 are decimal numbers counting from one.  Missing levels
attribute means all.

style:: name of the style of index to output, see <<pis, Predefined Index
Styles>>

Configuration
-------------

Basic Configuration file format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic setting file format is a list of key=value entries, each
starting on a new line.

Keys are a dot separated list of keys for each level in the hierarchy.

Values are all text following the equals (=) not including leading or
trailing whitespace.  Values extend to include the next line(s) if the
last non-whitespace character of the line is a backslash (\\).

Lines beginning with # are coments and ignored.

For typing convenience lines beginning with open square bracket specify
a starting position in the hierarchy for all following keys until
another square bracket line.  The line consists of a dot separated
list of keys for each level followed by a close square bracket.

Settings Understood by Flexndex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following table items shown like *<this>* are placeholders to
be filled by the user with the appropriate values as explained after
the table.  All other characters in the setting are expected verbatim.

The substitutions column identifies which built-in attributes are
substituted, see the following table.

[cols="2,1,1,2"]
|====
| Setting | Optional, default | Substitutions | Use
| default_style | yes, 'simple-dotted' | nothing
| Name of default style if not specified in ixhere comment

| attribute.*<name>* | yes, nothing | nothing
| Value to substitute for occurrances of {name}

| anchors.*<backend>* | yes, nothing | std target
| Markup to output after the ix comment, usually defines a link anchor

| styles.*<style_name>*.*<backend>*.complete | yes, "no" | nothing
| Set to start with "y" to generate complete term hierarchy, ie if a,b,c
were the first terms then a and a,b would also be generated

| styles.*<style_name>*.*<backend>*.prefix | yes, nothing | std here
| Markup to output before the index

| styles.*<style_name>*.*<backend>*.postfix | yes, nothing | std here
| Markup to output after the index

| styles.*<style_name>*.*<backend>*.empty_message | yes, "Empty Index | std here
| Markup to output if the index has no contents, prefix and postfix not
output

| styles.*<style_name>*.*<backend>*.entry_start | yes, nothing | std here
| Markup to output before each entry

| styles.*<style_name>*.*<backend>*.entry_end | yes, nothing | std here
| Markup to output after each entry

| styles.*<style_name>*.*<backend>*.levels.*<level_no>*.text_internal
| yes, nothing | std here ixterm
| The markup to output if this term is not the last one for the target
entry

| styles.*<style_name>*.*<backend>*.levels.*<level_no>*.text_last
| yes, nothing | std here ixterm
| The markup to output for the last term if it cannot to be a link, ie
it has more than one target

| styles.*<style_name>*.*<backend>*.levels.*<level_no>*.link_last
| yes, nothing | std here ixterm target
| The markup to output for the last term if it can be a link

| styles.*<style_name>*.*<backend>*.levels.*<level_no>*.multi_target
| yes, nothing | std here ixterm target
| The markup to output for each of multiple targets
|====

Substitutions are not recursive, ie {attr} in an attribute value is not 
substituted when the attribute is.

The substitutions column in the above table means:

[cols="1,4", width="50%"]
|====
| std | Built-in and configured attributes
| here | Keyword attributes from the ixhere comment
| ixterm | The term value for the current level
| target
| The attributes from the ix comment and \{ixtgt} and \{tgt_text}^[1]^
|====

Notes:

[1] \{ixtgt} is a unique numeric piece of text identified with the
target, use it to make link targets, \{tgt_text} is either the 'text'
attribute from the ix comment, if it exists, otherwise the last term.

The following attributes are built-in, but can be overridden by config 
files:

|====
| Name | Value | Use
| sp | ' ' 
| Use for leading or trailing spaces where they would otherwise be 
stripped off

| nl | '\n' | Newline
|====

The meanings of the placeholders are:

style_name:: is the name of a style being defined

backend:: is the name of the backend that the setting applies to

level_no:: is the level of the term that this setting applies to.
Caution, level_no is text, it is not a number.  Convention is to use
"1", "2" etc as it just defines a sort order, beware "10" sorts before
"2".

Command Reference
-----------------

----
flexndex [options] infile outfile
----

Note that as the outfile is the same type as the infile there is no
obvious way of generating an output filename automatically, so both
infile and outfile are required.

Options are:

-b, --backend:: specify the backend format to generate output in,
built-in options are 'xhtml11',  and 'docbook45' which are aliased as
'html', and 'docbook' respectively.  Default is 'xhtml11'. Note
docbook not supported in v0.1.

-c, --config:: specify configuration files to load, can be specified
multiple times, settings in files to the right can override those to
the left or builtin configuration.  There are no default files loaded.

-h, --help:: print this reference and exit

--version:: print version and exit

[[pis]]
Predefined Index Styles
-----------------------

dotted:: a simple (no CSS) built-in non-grouped style that shows each entry as:
+
----
term1.term2.term3
term1.term2.term4 [target1] [target2]
----
+
where the term3 has only one target and term4 has multiple targets each
shown in []. The text term3, target1 and target2 are links.

simple-grouped:: a simple (no CSS) built-in grouped style shows as a traditional
grouped index as:
+
----
term1
    term2
        term3
        term4 [target1] [target2]
----
+
where term3 target1 and target2 are links.

Using With Asciidoc
-------------------

Flexndex can be used with the xml generated by the Asciidoc tool in
xhtml11, docbook and ODT backends.

The easiest way of inserting Flexndex comments is to define two
macros:

----
ix:indexname[attribute_list]
ishere::indexname[attrbiute_list]
----

to generate the index target comments and index comments respectively.
Note the ixhere macro is a block macro and ix is inline.

Put the following in an appropriate asciidoc.conf file:

----
[macros]
(?su)(?<!\w)[\\]?(?P<name>ix):(?P<target>\S*?)\[(?P<attrlist>.*?)\]:
(?u)(?<!\w)[\\]?(?P<name>ixhere)::(?P<target>\S*?)\[(?P<attrlist>.*?)\]: #

[ix-inlinemacro]
<!-- ix {target} <{attrlist}> -->

[ixhere-blockmacro]
<!-- ixhere {target} <{attrlist=}> -->
----

or if using a release after 8.6.7 or hg newer than release
c715f6c96481 (June 10 2012) then you can place:

----
:macros.(?su)(?<!\w)[\\]?(?P<name>ix):(?P<target>\S*?)\[(?P<attrlist>.*?)\]:
:macros.(?u)(?<!\w)[\\]?(?P<name>ixhere)::(?P<target>\S*?)\[(?P<attrlist>.*?)\]: #
:ix-inlinemacro.: <!-- ix {target} <{attrlist}> -->
:ixhere-blockmacro.: <!-- ixhere {target} <{attrlist=}> -->
----

in the header of the document and avoid the need for a separate
asciidoc.conf.

Run asciidoc to create the .html or .xml file then run flexndex.  The
xml can then be processed further by a2x as normal by specifying the
.xml file output from flexndex as input to a2x.

Futures
-------

Probable
~~~~~~~~

- switch built-in styles to config file format as a string
- docbook built-ins
- multi-column indices
