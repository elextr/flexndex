Introduction
------------

Most documentation tools let you generate an index of terms in the 
document, but often it is useful to be able to generate indices for 
special purposes.  For example if you are documenting software and 
index to functions, an index to types etc may be useful.

Flexndex is a flexible tool to generate multiple indices as document 
internal links, making it usable with most XML based document formats, 
eg xhtml, docbook or Open Document Format.

For more information see the full manual.

Installation
------------

Flexndex is a single python file.  Just place it in your python path. 
Requires Python 2.7.

The manual is available in Asciidoc and html formats.
